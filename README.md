# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview
This is a Rock Paper Scissors project that gave me some practice with the implementation of the JavaScript functions and Problem Solving concepts which I learned from the Odin Project. It has made me confident with Problem Solving and JavaScript functions overall.

## Details
I started by writing a bunch of pseudocode to implement my problem solving and simplification approach, like so (rough example but it helped a ton!):

```
DECLARE humanScore and computerScore variable in global scope

FUNCTION getComputerChoice()
  Generate a random number
  IF evaluate the number on 3 approximations
    RETURN computerChoice that satisfies the condition

FUNCTION getHumanChoice()
  INPUT a choice from the user
  RETURN the humanChoice

FUNCTION playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice)
  [Logic for playing one round]

STRING humanSelection = getHumanChoice()
STRING computerSelection = getComputerChoice()

CALL playRound(humanSelection, computerSelection)
```

After this, I began writing my JavaScript code based on the pseudocode that I came up with, while following the directions from the given assignment by the Odin Project, of course. This project made a very heavy use of functions and that ultimately resulted in my code being more readable, along with being more managable. Moreover, the Problem Solving lesson from the Odin Project has influenced this project A LOT. I implemented all those techniques and got used to a more proper approach most beginning programmers should take (but fail to).

I'm aware that I'm not done with the project just yet, there are a few more things ahead, like DOM Manipulation and that's what I'm excited about, let's see how it goes!
